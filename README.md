## PyE-App  

pye app is a web application that does simple statistical calculations, it was a project I did in high school :)

**suggestions**
In the backend there are some that can be improved using node modules and improve the creation of 
files and in the frontend it is necessary to validate the data before reaching the backend I leave 
it to your consideration to do it
